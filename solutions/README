max-sat-solution.npz - Solutions of MAX-SAT variant of the problem for various
    constellation sizes ranging from 1 to 70. These solutions nest. This file
    contains two fields: "constellation" a (70, 469)-shape boolean array
    describing the car feature set state space on each row and
    "constellation_type_indices" a (70,)-shape integer array describing the car
    type index for each row of "constellation". These two data fields represent
    the complete state space solutions of the MAX-SAT problem. Note that all
    644 test rules are exactly satisfied by the 60-car constellation, so the
    extra cars from index 60 onward do not improve the solution and may be
    discarded.
scheduling-solution.txt - Solution of the Scheduling variant of the problem
    using the 60-car exact SAT constellation from the previous paragraph to
    schedule all 766 unique tests (including multiplicity considerations) over
    78 days with a maximum of 10 tests on distinct cars performed on within
    each day, and respecting test group priorities and performing multi-car
    tests on different cars. Each entry in this file contains the timeslot
    (i.e., "day") on the rows and the testslot (i.e., "engineer") on the columns.
    The "Car Indices" entry lists the indices of the cars in the 60-car exact
    SAT constellation to be used. The "Test Indices" lists the test index from
    the original test rules list to be performed. These two data fields
    represent the complete state space of the scheduling solutions.
