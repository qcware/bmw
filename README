QC Ware code and solutions repository for efforts related to the "Optimizing the 
Production of Test Vehicles" challenge problem of the 
BMW Quantum Computing Challenge

prompt - PDF of use case problem statement from BMW
data - test problem data from BMW (refined for easy parsing)
bmw - main C++/Python library source code. After building and placing the repo
    dir in your PYTHONPATH, python -c 'import bmw'` should work
env - simple environment shell scripts to add bmw to PYTHONPATH
prod-1 - first production run of test case
notes - working notes on observations of problems
report - placeholder for finished project report

solutions - finished copies of the numerical data of the QC Ware solutions,
    i.e., detailed feature state space configurations and car types for the
    MAX-SAT problem and the detailed schedule of constellation car indices and
    test indices for the Scheduling problem.
